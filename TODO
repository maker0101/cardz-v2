app todos

- auth (better-auth? i think so, so that it can work locally too)
- shopping cart

app bugs

- factor mousedown into reusable <Link> element
- figure out env vars, omg - they are hard-coded everywhere
  - need to interpolate for zero_upstream_db
- use real drizzle migrations
- nicer styles
- pull css into separate files
- weird scroll margin thing on virtualizer
- it would be nicer to sort by popularity/rating - can we get this data somehow? then we'd probably also preload less.
- the search ui is surprisingly slow
- is there a watch mode for drizzle-zero
- can we move better-auth to a better-directory-name? why does it have to be in app/lib!?
- should we be auto-pushing the schema in dev?
  - and if we are not, does that mean we should not be auto-generating the zero-schema?
- extract inline styles out in whatever way is standard for tanstack start - module css? something else?

zero bugs

- what's required to get zero userID working right in react feels like way too much. what can we abstract?
- setting up better-auth jwt is alot. better-auth guy says we should use tanstack query? does it help?
- it is weird that zero itself reads .env. maybe it should do, but shouldn't be an error.
- you should be able to start w/o a schema.ts
- stupid to have to useZero() just to form queries
- debug panel would be super useful for just "why don't i have data??"
- fix preload api
- data stored seems to be growing on each reload!! is this supposed to happen??
  - i sorta vaguely feel this is fallout of offline support
  - but also i see us redownloading the entire albumset on every refresh - this definitely not supposed to happen
- numeric start so can do proper paging
- fix @rocicorp/zero-sqlite3 for up arrow to work and document better
- several bugs with query caching (reported on zbugs)
- conditional query (for when session is null and using userID in query)
- remove 20k limit, or at least put a warning or something. behavior is super weird when you cross it, zero immediately nukes the preload and starts over.
- warn about missing FKs it makes zero crazy slow.
