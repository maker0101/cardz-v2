app todos

- figure out env vars, omg - they are hard-coded everywhere
  - need to interpolate for zero_upstream_db
- use real drizzle migrations
- nicer styles
- pull css into separate files
- weird scroll margin thing on virtualizer
- it would be nicer to sort by popularity/rating - can we get this data somehow? then we'd probably also preload less.

zero todos

- it is weird that zero itself reads .env. maybe it should do, but shouldn't be an error.
- you should be able to start w/o a schema.ts
- stupid to have to useZero() just to form queries
- debug panel would be super useful for just "why don't i have data??"
- schema should just be a plain json format, not so fancy
- fix preload api
- data stored seems to be growing on each reload!! is this supposed to happen??
  - i sorta vaguely feel this is fallout of offline support
  - but also i see us redownloading the entire albumset on every refresh - this definitely not supposed to happen
