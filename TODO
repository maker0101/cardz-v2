app todos
- figure out env vars, omg - they are hard-coded everywhere
  - need to interpolate for zero_upstream_db
- use real drizzle migrations

zero todos
- it is weird that zero itself reads .env. maybe it should do, but shouldn't be an error.
- you should be able to start w/o a schema.ts
- stupid to have to useZero() just to form queries
- debug panel would be super useful for just "why don't i have data??"
