app todos

- auth (better-auth? i think so, so that it can work locally too)
- shopping cart

app bugs

- factor mousedown into reusable <FastLink> element
- figure out env vars, omg - they are hard-coded everywhere
  - need to interpolate for zero_upstream_db
- use real drizzle migrations
- nicer styles
- pull inline styles out into whatever is standard for tanstack start - module css? something else?
- should we be auto-pushing the schema in dev?
  - and if we are not, does that mean we should not be auto-generating the zero-schema?
- why doesn't formatter run on zero dir
- change all the relative paths to use ~ shortcut - tanstack start has docs on this

zero bugs

- the pattern of making the zero instance reactive feels right but had to hack around current code in zero/react. Can we make this easier? Need to consider having multiple zero instances live.
- setting up better-auth jwt is alot. better-auth guy says we should use tanstack query? does it help?
- it is weird that zero itself reads .env. maybe it should do, but shouldn't be an error if env not present.
- you should be able to start w/o a schema.ts
- stupid to have to useZero() just to form queries
  - this would make sharing query fragments more elegant too (see artist.tsx)
- debug panel would be super useful for just "why don't i have data??"
- fix preload api to not block ui queries
- exceeding 20k limit causes all data to get dropped - pretty surprising. we should remove the limit in ttl v2.
- fix @rocicorp/zero-sqlite3 for up arrow to work and document better
- conditional query (for when session is null and using userID in query)
- warn about missing FKs it makes zero crazy slow.
- it would be nice if tx.insert() returned the value.
