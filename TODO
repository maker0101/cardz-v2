app todos

- when nuking db state, auth token not accepted and seems like need to login/logout again. should this be more automated?
- CD to vercel/fly/supabase
  - I guess this implies getting env vars working properly
- Previews
- mooar data
- can we integrate with ts even better?
  - router would give nicer preloads
  - query would give suspense and maybe ssr!?

app bugs

- add to cart button should be mousedown
- factor mousedown into reusable <FastLink> element
- use real drizzle migrations
- nicer styles
- pull inline styles out into whatever is standard for tanstack start - module css? something else?
- should we be auto-pushing the schema in dev?
  - and if we are not, does that mean we should not be auto-generating the zero-schema?
- why doesn't formatter run on zero dir
- change all the relative paths to use ~ shortcut - tanstack start has docs on this
- the name of this app should change, it's no longer and itunes app. should it be zero-records? ts follow a convention like tanstack-sample-trelleaux-convex, so an alternate could be like zero-sample-tanstack-drizzle-betterauth ? kinda long but nice in that it is very self-explanatory.

zero bugs

- text search
- the pattern of making the zero instance reactive feels right but had to hack around current code in zero/react. Can we make this easier? Need to consider having multiple zero instances live.
- setting up better-auth jwt is alot. better-auth guy says we should use tanstack query? does it help?
- stupid to have to useZero() just to form queries
  - this would make sharing query fragments more elegant too (see artist.tsx)
- debug panel would be super useful for just "why don't i have data??"
  - maybe it should also show mutations - would have fixed a bug i struggled with for a bit
- fix preload api to not block ui queries
- exceeding 20k limit causes all data to get dropped - pretty surprising. we should remove the limit in ttl v2.
- fix @rocicorp/zero-sqlite3 for up arrow to work and document better
- warn about missing index on FK it makes zero crazy slow.
- it is weird that zero itself reads .env. maybe it should do, but shouldn't be an error if env not present.
- you should be able to start w/o a schema.ts
- conditional query (for when session is null and using userID in query)
- it would be nice if tx.insert() returned the value.
- zero-deploy-permissions should also pay attention to .env
- client-only queries
